abstract: 'Predictive models mapping double-stranded DNA to signals of regulatory
  activity should, in principle, produce analogous (or “equivariant”) predictions
  whether the forward strand or its reverse complement (RC) is supplied as input.
  Unfortunately, standard neural networks can produce highly divergent predictions
  across strands, even when the training set is augmented with RC sequences. Two strategies
  have emerged to enforce equivariance: conjoined/“siamese” architectures, and RC
  parameter sharing or RCPS. However, the connections between the two remain unclear,
  comparisons to strong baselines are lacking, and neither has been adapted to base-resolution
  signal profile prediction. In this work, we extend conjoined & RCPS models to base-resolution
  signal prediction, and introduce a strong baseline: a standard model (trained with
  RC data augmentation) that is made conjoined only after training, which we call
  “post-hoc” conjoined. Through benchmarks on diverse tasks, we find post-hoc conjoined
  consistently performs best or second-best, surpassed only occasionally by RCPS,
  and never underperforms conjoined-during-training. We propose an overfitting-based
  hypothesis for the latter finding, and study it empirically. Despite its theoretical
  appeal, RCPS shows mediocre performance on several tasks, even though (as we prove)
  it can represent any solution learned by conjoined models. Our results suggest users
  interested in RC equivariance should default to post-hoc conjoined as a reliable
  baseline before exploring RCPS. Finally, we present a unified description of conjoined
  & RCPS architectures, revealing a broader class of models that gradually interpolate
  between RCPS and conjoined while maintaining equivariance. The code to replicate
  the experiments is available at https://github.com/hannahgz/BenchmarkRCStrategies.
