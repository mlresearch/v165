abstract: Deep learning provides a tool for improving screening of candidates for
  drug re- purposing to treat neglected diseases. We show how a new pipeline can be
  devel- oped to address the needs of repurposing for Leishmaniasis. In combination
  with traditional molecular docking techniques, this allows top candidates to be
  selected and analyzed, including for molecular descriptor similarity.
