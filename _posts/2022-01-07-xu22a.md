abstract: Protein engineering is currently being revolutionized by deep learning applications,
  especially through natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It has been shown
  that state-of-the-art self-supervised language models trained on entire protein
  databases capture hidden contextual and structural information in amino acid sequences
  and are capable of improving sequence-to-function predictions. Yet, recent studies
  have reported that current compound-protein modeling approaches perform poorly on
  learning interactions between enzymes and substrates of interest within one protein
  family. We attribute this to low-grade substrate encoding methods and overcompressed
  sequence representations received by downstream predictive models. In this study,
  we propose a new substrate-encoding based on Extended Connectivity Fingerprints
  (ECFPs) and a convolutional-pooling of the sequence embeddings. Through testing
  on an activity profiling dataset of haloalkanoate dehalogenase superfamily that
  measures activities of 218 phosphatases against 168 substrates, we show substantial
  improvements in predictive performances of compound-protein interaction modeling.
  In addition, we also test the workflow on three other datasets from the halogenase,
  kinase and aminotransferase families and show that our pipeline achieves good performance
  on these datasets as well. We further demonstrate the utility of this downstream
  model architecture by showing that it achieves good performance with six different
  protein embeddings, including ESM-1b, TAPE, ProtBert, ProtAlbert, ProtT5, and ProtXLNet.
  This study provides a new workflow for activity prediction on novel substrates that
  can be used to engineer new enzymes for sustainability applications.
