abstract: Deep neural networks and support vector machines have been shown to accurately
  predict genome-wide signals of regulatory activity from raw DNA sequences. These
  models are appealing in part because they can learn predictive DNA sequence features
  without prior assumptions. Several methods such as in-silico mutagenesis, GradCAM,
  DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients and GkmExplain have been developed to reveal these
  learned features. However, the behavior of these methods on regulatory genomic data
  remains an area of active research. Although prior work has benchmarked these methods
  on simulated datasets with known ground-truth motifs, these simulations employed
  highly simplified regulatory logic that is not representative of the genome. In
  this work, we propose a novel pipeline for designing simulated data that comes closer
  to modeling the complexity of regulatory genomic DNA. We apply the pipeline to build
  simulated datasets based on publicly-available chromatin accessibility experiments
  and use these datasets to benchmark different interpretation methods based on their
  ability to identify ground-truth motifs. We find that a GradCAM-based method, which
  was reported to perform well on a more simplified dataset, does not do well on this
  dataset (particularly when using an architecture with shorter convolutional kernels
  in the first layer), and we theoretically show that this is expected based on the
  nature of regulatory genomic data. We also show that Integrated Gradients sometimes
  performs worse than gradient-times-input, likely owing to its linear interpolation
  path. We additionally explore the impact of user-defined settings on the interpretation
  methods, such as the choice of “reference”/“baseline”, and identify recommended
  settings for genomics. Our analysis suggests several promising directions for future
  research on these model interpretation methods. Code and links to data are available
